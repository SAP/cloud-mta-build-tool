The archive builder is used on a file system that is independent from the development environment where the application project was created. The archive builder is supported on Windows and Linux operating systems. If you previously used the Multitarget Application Archive Builder for building your MTA projects, see the topic: differences between the tools . Multitarget Application Before using this package, you should be familiar with the multitarget application concept and terminology. For background and detailed information, see the Multi-Target Application Model guide. Creating an MTA Archive According to the MTA Development Descriptor ( mta.yaml file) The build process and the resulting multitarget application archive depend on the target platform where the archive will be deployed. The currently supported target platforms are SAP Cloud Platform (both the Neo and Cloud Foundry environments) and the SAP HANA XS advanced model. Each module is built using the build technology that is either associated with the module type by default or is configured explicitly. Then the results of each module's build are packaged into an archive together with the multitarget application deployment descriptor. The deployment descriptor is created based on the structure of the multitarget application project, the multitarget application development descriptor ( mta.yaml file), the extension descriptors, if they are supplied (the builder merges them with the mta.yaml file), and the command-line options. In the deployment descriptor, the design-time modules are converted into the module types that are recognized by the respective target platforms. The resulting multitarget application archive can then be deployed on the required target platform. For more details about how the design-time module types in the mta.yaml file are converted into deployment time module types in the mtad.yaml file according to the target platform, see Module types conversion . If the MTA Build Tool encounters a module type in the mta.yaml file that is not listed in the configuration file, its definition is copied to the mtad.yaml file as is and the zip builder is applied to the module (in other words, the archived module sources are packaged as the build result). All resource definitions are passed to the mtad.yaml file as is without mapping and validations (for example, if the resource is supported in the target platform or if the specified parameters match the type).

For each module, the Cloud MTA Build Tool performs a build operation using a default technology specific for the module type, for example, the npm builder. For the complete list of available builders and their default behaviors, see Builders Execution Commands . To find out which builder is applied to a module if the builder parameters are not explicitly set in the MTA development descriptor file ( mta.yaml ), see Modules' default builder configuration . The following sections describe in detail how to configure each of the supported builders. Configuring a builder for a module To use a non-default builder for a module, specify its name in the builder parameter. - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: builder: zip Configuring build order You can define the dependencies between modules to ensure that they are built in a certain order. In addition, you can use the build results of one module to build another module. Also you can can configure build steps that are performed before building any of the modules. Defining module build order To define the build order of modules, in the mta.yaml file, add a requires section under the build-parameters section of the dependent module; that is, a module that should be built only after building another required module. Then specify the required module name as a property of the dependent module\u2019s requires section. The example mta.yaml file below demonstrates how to build module A after module B: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: requires: - name: B - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB NOTE: The order of modules in the mta.yaml file is not important as long as the requires sections have been coded with the relevant dependencies. CAUTION: Cyclical dependencies are not allowed. If such dependencies are found, the build fails. Using build results for building another module If you want to use the build results of module B for building module A, modify the requires section as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: requires: - name: B artifacts: [ * ] target-path: newfolder - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB Configuring a global build If you want to run addtional build steps before running builders of the specific modules, define it by using the build-parameters section at global level in the mta.yaml file as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 build-parameters: before-all: builders: - builder: npm modules: ... You can configure any of the supported builders. Also, you can list several builders and they will run in the specified order. ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 build-parameters: before-all: builders: - builder: custom commands: - npm run script1 - builder: grunt modules: ... NOTE: Only the following build parameters are considered when configuring a builder at the global level: timeout commands (for the custom builder only) fetcher-opts (for the fetcher builder only) Configuring the fetcher builder The fetcher builder can be used for packaging already available Maven artifacts into a multitarget application archive as the module\u2019s build results. - name: my_module build-parameters: builder: fetcher fetcher-opts: repo-type: maven repo-coordinates: mygroup:myart:1.0.0 The repo-coordinates parameter is a string of the form groupId:artifactId:version[:packaging[:classifier]] . This is equivalent to a Maven dependency command, delegating the specified coordinates to the standard Maven dependency mechanism: mvn dependency:copy -Dartifact=mygroup:myart:1.0.0 Configuring the custom builder You can define your own build commands by configuring a custom builder as follows: - name: my_module build-parameters: builder: custom commands: - npm install - grunt - npm prune --production When used for configuring a module builder, you can omit the commands parameters; then no build is performed and the module's root folder or a folder specified in the build-result is packaged into the MTA archive. Configuring module build artifacts to package into MTA archive You can configure the following build parameters to define artifacts to package into the MTA archive for the specific module: Name Default value Description build-result The module folder A folder containing the build results to package. ignore None Files and/or subfolders to exclude from the package. For example: - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: builder: zip build-result: myfolder ignore: [ *.txt , mtaignore/ ] NOTE: These parameters are not considered for the fetcher builder. Configuring and packaging modules according to target platforms If you want to control which modules should be packaged into a multitarget application archive for a specific platform, use the supported-platforms build parameter as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '2.0' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: supported-platforms: [NEO, CF] - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB build-parameters: supported-platforms: [NEO] - name: C type: html5 path: pathtomoduleC build-parameters: supported-platforms: [] If you build an application with the multitarget application descriptor above for a CF (Cloud Foundry) target, all its modules are built, but the resulting multitarget application archive and deployment descriptor include module A only. If you build the same application for a NEO target, the multitarget application archive includes module A and module B. If you have a module C with an empty supported platform list, it is never included in any multitarget application archive, regardless of the target platform of the specific multitarget application build. If the supported-platforms build parameter is not used, the module is packaged for any target platform. You can use these values or any combination of these values for the supported-platforms build parameter: CF for the SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment NEO for the SAP Cloud Platform Neo environment XSA for the SAP HANA XS advanced model Configuring timeout sessions This feature is not yet supported by the tool. Configuring the build artifact name The module build results are by default packaged into the resulting archive under the name \u201cdata\u201d. You can change this name as needed using the build-artifact-name build parameter: modules: - name: db type: hdb path: db build-parameters: build-artifact-name: myfileName NOTE: The file extension is not configurable; it is predefined by the module type (.zip or .war).","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#overview","text":"Optionally, you can define the builder behavior by configuring the parameters in the build-parameters section in the mta.yaml file for each module or globally.

How to build an MTA archive from the project sources Overview You can use one of the following two approaches for building your MTA project: - One-step build using the mbt build command - Two-step build using a combination of the mbt init and make commands. Both methods leverage the GNU Make technology for the actual build. If you are using the one-step approach, the tool generates a temporary build configuration file and automatically invokes the make command. The generated Makefile is then deleted at the end of the build. The second approach allows you to generate the Makefile using the mbt init command. You can adjust the generated file according to your project needs and then build the MTA archive using the make command. In this case, we recommend that you include the generated Makefile in the project's source control management system to ensure that the same build process is applied across all the project's contributors, regardless of the build environment. Prerequisites GNU Make 4.2.1 is installed in your build environment. Module build tools are installed in your build environment. For more information, see the corresponding Download and Installation sections .
