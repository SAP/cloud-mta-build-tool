The archive builder is used on a file system that is independent from the development environment where the application project was created. The archive builder is supported on Windows and Linux operating systems. If you previously used the Multitarget Application Archive Builder for building your MTA projects, see the topic: differences between the tools . Multitarget Application Before using this package, you should be familiar with the multitarget application concept and terminology. For background and detailed information, see the Multi-Target Application Model guide. Creating an MTA Archive According to the MTA Development Descriptor ( mta.yaml file) The build process and the resulting multitarget application archive depend on the target platform where the archive will be deployed. The currently supported target platforms are SAP Cloud Platform (both the Neo and Cloud Foundry environments) and the SAP HANA XS advanced model. Each module is built using the build technology that is either associated with the module type by default or is configured explicitly. Then the results of each module's build are packaged into an archive together with the multitarget application deployment descriptor. The deployment descriptor is created based on the structure of the multitarget application project, the multitarget application development descriptor ( mta.yaml file), the extension descriptors, if they are supplied (the builder merges them with the mta.yaml file), and the command-line options. In the deployment descriptor, the design-time modules are converted into the module types that are recognized by the respective target platforms. The resulting multitarget application archive can then be deployed on the required target platform. For more details about how the design-time module types in the mta.yaml file are converted into deployment time module types in the mtad.yaml file according to the target platform, see Module types conversion . If the MTA Build Tool encounters a module type in the mta.yaml file that is not listed in the configuration file, its definition is copied to the mtad.yaml file as is and the zip builder is applied to the module (in other words, the archived module sources are packaged as the build result). All resource definitions are passed to the mtad.yaml file as is without mapping and validations (for example, if the resource is supported in the target platform or if the specified parameters match the type).

For each module, the Cloud MTA Build Tool performs a build operation using a default technology specific for the module type, for example, the npm builder. For the complete list of available builders and their default behaviors, see Builders Execution Commands . To find out which builder is applied to a module if the builder parameters are not explicitly set in the MTA development descriptor file ( mta.yaml ), see Modules' default builder configuration . The following sections describe in detail how to configure each of the supported builders. Configuring a builder for a module To use a non-default builder for a module, specify its name in the builder parameter. - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: builder: zip Configuring build order You can define the dependencies between modules to ensure that they are built in a certain order. In addition, you can use the build results of one module to build another module. Also you can can configure build steps that are performed before building any of the modules. Defining module build order To define the build order of modules, in the mta.yaml file, add a requires section under the build-parameters section of the dependent module; that is, a module that should be built only after building another required module. Then specify the required module name as a property of the dependent module\u2019s requires section. The example mta.yaml file below demonstrates how to build module A after module B: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: requires: - name: B - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB NOTE: The order of modules in the mta.yaml file is not important as long as the requires sections have been coded with the relevant dependencies. CAUTION: Cyclical dependencies are not allowed. If such dependencies are found, the build fails. Using build results for building another module If you want to use the build results of module B for building module A, modify the requires section as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: requires: - name: B artifacts: [ * ] target-path: newfolder - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB Configuring a global build If you want to run addtional build steps before running builders of the specific modules, define it by using the build-parameters section at global level in the mta.yaml file as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 build-parameters: before-all: - builder: npm modules: ... You can configure any of the supported builders. Also, you can list several builders and they will run in the specified order. ID: myproject _schema-version: '3.1' version: 0.0.1 build-parameters: before-all: builders: - builder: custom commands: - npm run script1 - builder: grunt modules: ... NOTE: Only the following build parameters are considered when configuring a builder at the global level: timeout commands (for the custom builder only) fetcher-opts (for the fetcher builder only) Configuring the fetcher builder The fetcher builder can be used for packaging already available Maven artifacts into a multitarget application archive as the module\u2019s build results. - name: my_module build-parameters: builder: fetcher fetcher-opts: repo-type: maven repo-coordinates: mygroup:myart:1.0.0 The repo-coordinates parameter is a string of the form groupId:artifactId:version[:packaging[:classifier]] . This is equivalent to a Maven dependency command, delegating the specified coordinates to the standard Maven dependency mechanism: mvn dependency:copy -Dartifact=mygroup:myart:1.0.0 Configuring the custom builder You can define your own build commands by configuring a custom builder as follows: - name: my_module build-parameters: builder: custom commands: - npm install - grunt - npm prune --production When used for configuring a module builder, you can leave the commands parameter list empty: - name: my_module build-parameters: builder: custom commands: [] In this case, no build is performed and the module's root folder or a folder specified in the build-result is packaged into the MTA archive. Configuring module build artifacts to package into MTA archive You can configure the following build parameters to define artifacts to package into the MTA archive for the specific module: Name Default value Description build-result For the maven builder: module's folder /target/*.war For the fetcher builder: module's folder /target/*.* For other builders: module's folder A path to the build results that should be packaged. ignore None Files and/or subfolders to exclude from the package. The provided paths should be relative to the build result folder, which can be the module's root folder (default) or the folder specified in the build-result parameter. For example: - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: builder: zip build-result: myfolder ignore: [ *.txt , mtaignore/ ] # In this example, the following will not be packaged in to MTA archive: # all files with the txt extension and the mtaignore folder within the myfolder directory. NOTE: These parameters are not considered for the fetcher builder. Configuring and packaging modules according to target platforms If you want to control which modules should be packaged into a multitarget application archive for a specific platform, use the supported-platforms build parameter as follows: ID: myproject _schema-version: '2.0' version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: A type: html5 path: pathtomoduleA build-parameters: supported-platforms: [NEO, CF] - name: B type: html5 path: pathtomoduleB build-parameters: supported-platforms: [NEO] - name: C type: html5 path: pathtomoduleC build-parameters: supported-platforms: [] If you build an application with the multitarget application descriptor above for a CF (Cloud Foundry) target, all its modules are built, but the resulting multitarget application archive and deployment descriptor include module A only. If you build the same application for a NEO target, the multitarget application archive includes module A and module B. If you have a module C with an empty supported platform list, it is never included in any multitarget application archive, regardless of the target platform of the specific multitarget application build. If the supported-platforms build parameter is not used, the module is packaged for any target platform. You can use these values or any combination of these values for the supported-platforms build parameter: CF for the SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment NEO for the SAP Cloud Platform Neo environment XSA for the SAP HANA XS advanced model Configuring timeout sessions When you build a specific module, there is a default 5-minute timeout allowance. After this time, the build will fail. You can configure the time allowed for timeout when performing a build by adding the timeout property to the module build parameters. The timeout property uses the number of hours h number of minutes m number of seconds s format. For example: - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: timeout: 6m30s Also, you can use this parameter to define timeout for the global before-all build . Configuring the build artifact name The module build results are by default packaged into the resulting archive under the name \u201cdata\u201d. You can change this name as needed using the build-artifact-name build parameter: modules: - name: db type: hdb path: db build-parameters: build-artifact-name: myfileName NOTE: The file extension is not configurable; it is predefined by the module type (.zip or .war). Configuring a module that does not have source code to build and package There are use cases when a module does not have any source code that should be built and therefore there are no build results to be packaged into the MTA archive. The module definition in the MTA descriptor is the only input that is required to deploy the module into the target environment. You can instruct the tool to treat the module as such by setting the build parameter no-source to true as follows: modules: - name: module1 ... build-parameters: no-source: true When the no-source parameter is true , the tool does not validate the path property, so it can be omitted as shown in the example above. No action is performed during the module's build step, so all parameters configuring the module build behaviour, e.g. builder , timeout , ignore , etc. are ignored. There is no content associated with this module in the result MTA archive. The rest of the module processing is the same as when the parameter is not provided, e.g. the entry in the generated the deployment descriptor is created based on supported-platforms settings.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#overview","text":"Optionally, you can define the builder behavior by configuring the parameters in the build-parameters section in the mta.yaml file for each module or globally.

Features that are handled differently in the Cloud MTA Build Tool The Cloud MTA build Tool uses GNU Make technology for building an MTA project. Therefore, you should have GNU Make installed in your build environmnet. For more information, see sections GNU Make installation and commands for building a project . Packaging of HTML5 modules in deploy_mode=html5-repo You need to update your mta.yaml file to exclude html5 modules from the resulting MTA archive and configure the build result folder. In order to do that, add the following to the build-parameters section for each module of this type: build-parameters: supported-platforms: [] build-result: dist For more information about the supported-platforms build parameter, see Configuring and Packaging Modules According to Target Platforms . The following build-parameters are not supported by the Cloud MTA Build Tool: npm-opts grunt-opt maven-opts If you need to change the default build behavior defined for the corresponding builder, see configure custom builder . For a complete list of available builders and their default behaviors, see Builders execution commands . If you replace the maven builder with the custom builder, you also need to set the build-result parameter (if it was not configured explicitly) as follows: - name: module1 type: java build-parameters: builder: custom ... build-result: target/*.war ... The Cloud MTA Build tool strictly validates the rule that names of modules, resources, and provided property sets, are unique within the mta.yaml file. This ensures that when the name is referenced in the requires section, it is unambiguously resolved. The Multitarget Application Archive Builder allowed the use of the same name for a module and for one of its property sets. For example: - name: SOME_NAME type: java path: srv provides: - name: SOME_NAME properties: url: ${default-url} When migrating to the new build tool, you need to rename either the module or the provided property set. For example: - name: SOME_NAME type: java path: srv provides: - name: SOME_NAME_API # New name properties: url: ${default-url} After renaming, make sure that the places where the name is used refer to the correct artifact. The hdb builder is not supported by the Cloud MTA Build tool. You no longer require builder settings for the hdb module because the required npm install --production command is run by default for this module type. If you used this builder for other module types, you can repace it with the npm builder or use the custom builder that runs the \"npm install --production\" command. NOTE: If you try to build the project without the changes above, the build tool will identify this and will fail the build with the corresponding errors. Service creation or service binding parameters provided in external files and referenced by the path property of the correponding entity in the mta.yaml are packaged differently by the tools into the result MTA archive. Therefore, if you have a JSON file with service creation parameters or service binding parameters and your JSON file contains parameters or placeholders that should be resolved when you deploy the MTA archive, the correponding properties should be moved to the mta.yaml file. Otherwise, values assigned to these properties during deployment will be incorrect, because the parameters or placeholders are resolved only if they are specified within an MTA descriptor, i.e. the mta.yaml or mtad.yaml files. For example, if you provide parameters for creating a UAA service in an xs-security.json file: resources: - name: my-uaa type: com.sap.xs.uaa parameters: path: ./xs-security.json and your xs-security.json file contains a property whose value should be resolved during the MTA archive deployment: { xsappname : ${default-xsappname} } then, you need to modify your mta.yaml file as follows: resources: - name: my-uaa type: com.sap.xs.uaa parameters: path: ./xs-security.json config: xsappname: ${default-xsappname} In the xs-security.json file, you can assign the property a temporary value that does not use the parameter. During deployment, the value specified directly in the MTA descriptor overrides the value specified in the JSON file. { xsappname : tmp_appname } Alternatively, you can remove the property from your xs-security.json file. NOTE: If you try to deploy the project without the changes above, the deploy service will identify this and will fail the deployment with the corresponding errors. Migration of SAP Web IDE Full-Stack Extensions If you have custom extensions for SAP Web IDE Full-Stack and you need to re-build them using the Cloud MTA Build Tool, for example, as part of a new version release process, you should adjust the mta.yaml file of the extension MTA project following the steps specified in the comments below: _schema-version: 2.0.0 ID: sample version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: sample type: html5 path: public provides: - name: sample # 1.

For example: - name: SOME_NAME type: java path: srv provides: - name: SOME_NAME_API # New name properties: url: ${default-url} After renaming, make sure that the places where the name is used refer to the correct artifact. The hdb builder is not supported by the Cloud MTA Build tool. You no longer require builder settings for the hdb module because the required npm install --production command is run by default for this module type. If you used this builder for other module types, you can repace it with the npm builder or use the custom builder that runs the \"npm install --production\" command. NOTE: If you try to build the project without the changes above, the build tool will identify this and will fail the build with the corresponding errors. Service creation or service binding parameters provided in external files and referenced by the path property of the correponding entity in the mta.yaml are packaged differently by the tools into the result MTA archive. Therefore, if you have a JSON file with service creation parameters or service binding parameters and your JSON file contains parameters or placeholders that should be resolved when you deploy the MTA archive, the correponding properties should be moved to the mta.yaml file. Otherwise, values assigned to these properties during deployment will be incorrect, because the parameters or placeholders are resolved only if they are specified within an MTA descriptor, i.e. the mta.yaml or mtad.yaml files. For example, if you provide parameters for creating a UAA service in an xs-security.json file: resources: - name: my-uaa type: com.sap.xs.uaa parameters: path: ./xs-security.json and your xs-security.json file contains a property whose value should be resolved during the MTA archive deployment: { xsappname : ${default-xsappname} } then, you need to modify your mta.yaml file as follows: resources: - name: my-uaa type: com.sap.xs.uaa parameters: path: ./xs-security.json config: xsappname: ${default-xsappname} In the xs-security.json file, you can assign the property a temporary value that does not use the parameter. During deployment, the value specified directly in the MTA descriptor overrides the value specified in the JSON file. { xsappname : tmp_appname } Alternatively, you can remove the property from your xs-security.json file. NOTE: If you try to deploy the project without the changes above, the deploy service will identify this and will fail the deployment with the corresponding errors.","title":"Features that are handled differently in the Cloud MTA Build Tool"},{"location":"migration/#migration-of-sap-web-ide-full-stack-extensions","text":"If you have custom extensions for SAP Web IDE Full-Stack and you need to re-build them using the Cloud MTA Build Tool, for example, as part of a new version release process, you should adjust the mta.yaml file of the extension MTA project following the steps specified in the comments below: _schema-version: 2.0.0 ID: sample version: 0.0.1 modules: - name: sample type: html5 path: public provides: - name: sample # 1.

How to build an MTA archive from the project sources Overview You can use one of the following two approaches for building your MTA project: - One-step build using the mbt build command - Two-step build using a combination of the mbt init and make commands. Both methods leverage the GNU Make technology for the actual build. If you are using the one-step approach, the tool generates a temporary build configuration file and automatically invokes the make command. The generated Makefile is then deleted at the end of the build. The second approach allows you to generate the Makefile using the mbt init command. You can adjust the generated file according to your project needs and then build the MTA archive using the make command. In this case, we recommend that you include the generated Makefile in the project's source control management system to ensure that the same build process is applied across all the project's contributors, regardless of the build environment. Prerequisites GNU Make 4.2.1 is installed in your build environment. Module build tools are installed in your build environment. For more information, see the corresponding Download and Installation sections . One-step build Quick start example: // Executes the MTA project build for the Cloud Foundry target environment. mbt build mbt build Generates a temporary Makefile according to the MTA descriptor and runs the make command to package the MTA project into the MTA archive.

Usage: mbt module-build flags Flags: Flag Mandatory / Optional Description Examples m (--module) Mandatory The name of the modules to build. Several modules separated by commas can be passed with a single flag, or each module can be specified with its own flag. Notes : If you specify several modules with a single flag, make sure there are no spaces between the names. The tool builds the specified modules in the order defined by the build parameters in the mta.yaml file. If the specified modules depend on other modules that should be built before, run the command with the --with-all-dependencies flag or specify the required modules explicitly. If the --target parameter is used, make sure that the names of the specified modules' build artifacts are unique. You can configure the build artifact name using the build-artifact-name build parameter as described here . mbt module-build -m=my_module,another_module or mbt module-build -m=my_module -m=another_module -a (--with-all-dependencies) Optional If this option is used, the tool builds all modules that the specified modules depend on in the order defined by the build parameters in the mta.yaml file before building the selected modules. Without this option, only the selected modules are built. mbt module-build -m=my_module,another_module -a -s (--source) Optional The path to the folder where the project\u2019s mta.yaml file is located; the current path is set as default. mbt module-build -m=my_module -s=C:/TestProject -t (--target) Optional The folder where the module build results will be saved. If this parameter is not provided, the module build results are saved in the current folder /. projectname _mta_build_tmp/ module name folder. If the parameter is provided, the build results are saved in the root of the folder provided by the argument. Note: If the --target parameter is used when building several modules, make sure that the names of the specified modules' build artifacts are unique. You can configure the build artifact name using the build-artifact-name build parameter as described here . mbt module-build -m=my_module -t=C:/TestProject/build_results_tmp The module\u2019s build results will be saved directly in the C:/TestProject/build_results_tmp/ folder -e (--extensions) Optional The path or paths to multitarget application extension files ( .mtaext ). Several extension files separated by commas can be passed with a single flag, or each extension file can be specified with its own flag. mbt module-build -m=my_module -e=test1.mtaext,test2.mtaext or mbt module-build -m=my_module -e=test1.mtaext -e=test2.mtaext -g (--mtad-gen) Optional If the parameter is provided, the deployment descriptor mtad.yaml is generated by default in the current folder or in the folder configured by the --target parameter. A module's path property in the generated mtad.yaml file points to the module's build results if this module was selected using the --modules option. Notes : The selected module list specified using the --module option, does not affect the list of modules in the resulting mtad.yaml file. The mtad.yaml file is always generated according to the default Cloud MTA Builder settings, the build-parameters configurations in the mta.yaml file (e.g. supported-platforms ), and the selected target platform. By default, the mtad.yaml is generated for the cf target platform. You can configure a different target plaform using the --platform option. mbt module-build -m=my_module1,my_module2 -g -p (--platform) Optional The name of the target deployment platform. Used only with the -g (--mtad-gen) parameter. The supported deployment platforms are: cf for SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry environment neo for the SAP Cloud Platform, Neo environment xsa for the SAP HANA XS advanced model If this parameter is not provided, the mtad.yaml file is generated for the SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry environment. mbt module-build -m=my_module1,my_module2 -g -p=neo","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#how-to-get-help-on-the-tools-commands","text":"Command Usage Description help mbt -h Prints all the available commands. help mbt [command] --help or mbt [command] -h Prints detailed information about the specified command.","title":"How to get help on the tools commands"},{"location":"usage/#how-to-find-out-the-version-of-the-installed-tool","text":"Command Usage Description version mbt -v Prints the current Cloud MTA Build Tool version.","title":"How to find out the version of the installed tool"},{"location":"usage/#how-to-build-an-mta-archive-from-the-project-sources","text":"","title":"How to build an MTA archive from the project sources"},{"location":"usage/#overview","text":"You can use one of the following two approaches for building your MTA project: - One-step build using the mbt build command - Two-step build using a combination of the mbt init and make commands.

These commands are useful if, for example, you want to build and deploy only specific modules for testing purposes, or if you decide to tailor your own build process for packaging MTA archives. At the moment, only the commands described below are supported. mbt mtad-gen Generates the MTA deployment descriptor ( mtad.yaml file) according to the provided MTA descriptor ( mta.yaml file) and MTA extensions. Usage: mbt mtad-gen flags Flags: Flag Mandatory / Optional Description Examples -p (--platform) Optional The name of the target deployment platform.

Usage: mbt module-build flags Flags: Flag Mandatory / Optional Description Examples m (--module) Mandatory The name of the modules to build. Several modules separated by commas can be passed with a single flag, or each module can be specified with its own flag. Notes : If you specify several modules with a single flag, make sure there are no spaces between the names. The tool builds the specified modules in the order defined by the build parameters in the mta.yaml file. If the specified modules depend on other modules that should be built before, run the command with the --with-all-dependencies flag or specify the required modules explicitly. If the --target parameter is used, make sure that the names of the specified modules' build artifacts are unique. You can configure the build artifact name using the build-artifact-name build parameter as described here . mbt module-build -m=my_module,another_module or mbt module-build -m=my_module -m=another_module -a (--with-all-dependencies) Optional If this option is used, the tool builds all modules that the specified modules depend on in the order defined by the build parameters in the mta.yaml file before building the selected modules. Without this option, only the selected modules are built. mbt module-build -m=my_module,another_module -a -s (--source) Optional The path to the folder where the project\u2019s mta.yaml file is located; the current path is set as default. mbt module-build -m=my_module -s=C:/TestProject -t (--target) Optional The folder where the module build results will be saved. If this parameter is not provided, the module build results are saved in the current folder /. projectname _mta_build_tmp/ module name folder. If the parameter is provided, the build results are saved in the root of the folder provided by the argument. Note: If the --target parameter is used when building several modules, make sure that the names of the specified modules' build artifacts are unique. You can configure the build artifact name using the build-artifact-name build parameter as described here . mbt module-build -m=my_module -t=C:/TestProject/build_results_tmp The module\u2019s build results will be saved directly in the C:/TestProject/build_results_tmp/ folder -e (--extensions) Optional The path or paths to multitarget application extension files ( .mtaext ). Several extension files separated by commas can be passed with a single flag, or each extension file can be specified with its own flag. mbt module-build -m=my_module -e=test1.mtaext,test2.mtaext or mbt module-build -m=my_module -e=test1.mtaext -e=test2.mtaext -g (--mtad-gen) Optional If the parameter is provided, the deployment descriptor mtad.yaml is generated by default in the current folder or in the folder configured by the --target parameter. A module's path property in the generated mtad.yaml file points to the module's build results if this module was selected using the --modules option. Notes : The selected module list specified using the --module option, does not affect the list of modules in the resulting mtad.yaml file. The mtad.yaml file is always generated according to the default Cloud MTA Builder settings, the build-parameters configurations in the mta.yaml file (e.g. supported-platforms ), and the selected target platform. By default, the mtad.yaml is generated for the cf target platform. You can configure a different target plaform using the --platform option. mbt module-build -m=my_module1,my_module2 -g -p (--platform) Optional The name of the target deployment platform. Used only with the -g (--mtad-gen) parameter.
