#              Content types mapping
# This file contains maps between file extension and content type
# it is bundled with the tool delivery as default to provide ease of use and quick start
# However, To create a clear separation between the build tool and content types
# the build tool will support a path for platform config file via CLI flags
# path to file which provide the a file with the following config format wins over the local config (i.e. from the repo)

# Note: in the future this file will be removed from the tool

# usage: to add new extensions to the file, execute command `go:generate`
# The command should be executed on the root project level to regenerate the file that contain the binary (see generator.go file)

# Types for cloudfoundry platform
