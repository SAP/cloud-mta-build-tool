#              Platform types mapping
# This file contains maps between platform types to native types
# it is bundled with the tool delivery as default to provide ease of use and quick start
# However, To create a clear separation between the build tool and platform types
# the build tool will support a path for platform config file via CLI flags
# path to file which provide the following config wins over the following config

# Note: in the future this file will be removed from the tool

# usage: to add new command to the file, execute command `go:generate`
# on the root project to regenerate the file binary
