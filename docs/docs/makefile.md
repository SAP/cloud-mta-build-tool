In order to build an MTA archive from a project's source code in a Windows environment, you should install `GNU Make 4.2.1` on your machine.

You can download the executable from a source that you trust according to your processor (32-bit or 64-bit) to a local folder and then add the folder to the PATH environment variable.  For example, you can download the tool from [here](https://github.com/mbuilov/gnumake-windows).

Alternatively, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make) to install or upgrade `GNU Make`.
