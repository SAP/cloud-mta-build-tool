#### Overview
[Micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) support various matching features, such as Glob pattern, Advanced globbing.

Micromatch is a nodejs application, and MBT is a go application. In order to enable MBT to use the functionalities provided by micromatch, from MBT v1.2.25, we create [micromath wrapper](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/tree/master/micromatch) to package it.
