## Description

#### Multi-Target Application

Before using this package, make sure that you are familiar with the multi-target application concept and terminology. For background and detailed information, see the [Multi-Target Application Model](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) guide. 

#### The Cloud MTA Build Tool overview
The Cloud MTA Build Tool is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready
multitarget application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the project’s MTA
development descriptor (`mta.yaml` file) or from module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file). Also, it provides commands for running intermediate build process steps; for example, the `mta.yaml` file validations, building a single module according to the configurations in the development descriptor, generating the deployment descriptor, and so on.
