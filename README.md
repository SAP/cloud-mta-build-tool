> <b>Disclaimer</b>: The multi-target application archive build tool is under heavy development and is currently in a `pre-alpha` stage.
                   Some functionality is still missing and the APIs are subject to change; use at your own risk.



## Description

The multi-target application archive builder is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready
multi-target application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the projectâ€™s MTA
development descriptor (`mta.yaml` file) or from module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file).

### Multi-Target Application

Before using this package, be sure you are familiar with the multi-target application concept and terminology.
For background and detailed information, see the [Multi-Target Application Model](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) guide.

| version | `mbt -v`     | Prints the multi-target application archive builder version.                                        | x
| help    | `mbt -h`     | Prints all the available commands.                             | x
| assemble    | `mbt assemble`     | Creates an MTA archive `.mtar` file from the module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file). Runs the command in the directory where the `mtad.yaml` file is located. **Note:** Make sure the path property of each module's `mtad.yaml` file points to the module's build artifacts you want to package into the target MTA archive. | x


For more information, see the command help output available via `mbt [command] --help` or `mbt [command] -h`.

## Download and Installation

 There are two supported ways to install the multi-target application archive builder (MBT) tool:

 **Manually**:
  1. [Download](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/releases) the **latest** binary file according to your operating system.
  2. Extract the archive file to the folder where you want to install the tool.
  3. Add the binary file to your `~/bin` path according to your operating system:     
        - Darwin / Linux
          - Copy the binary file to the `~/usr/local/bin/` folder, for example: `cp mbt /usr/local/bin/`
        - Windows
          -  Copy the binary file `mbt.exe` to the `C:/Windows/` folder.
