## Description

#### Multi-Target Application

Before using this package, make sure that you are familiar with the multi-target application concept and terminology. For background and detailed information, see the [Multi-Target Application Model](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) guide. 

#### The Cloud MTA Build Tool Overview
The Cloud MTA Build Tool is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready
multitarget application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the projectâ€™s MTA
development descriptor (`mta.yaml` file) or from module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file). Also, it provides commands for running intermediate build process steps; for example, the `mta.yaml` file validations, building a single module according to the configurations in the development descriptor, generating the deployment descriptor, and so on.


><b>For more information, see the [Cloud MTA Build Tool user guide](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/)</b>

#### Demo

This demo shows the basic usage of the tool. For more advanced scenarios, follow the documentation.

#### The Cloud MTA Build Tool Images
We supply serveral images for **CI environment** containg the Cloud MTA Build Tool. The images are hosted at [Github container registry](https://github.com/orgs/SAP/packages?tab=packages&q=mbtci-) and also at [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=mbtci-&type=image).
The images are built from template docker files which depend on most common technologies (Java and Node) as follows:
* [mbtci-java8-node12](https://hub.docker.com/r/devxci/mbtci-java8-node12) is built from [Dockerfile_mbtci_java8](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/blob/master/Dockerfile_mbtci_java8) using Node 12.
* [mbtci-java8-node14](https://hub.docker.com/r/devxci/mbtci-java8-node14) is built from [Dockerfile_mbtci_java8](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/blob/master/Dockerfile_mbtci_java8) using Node 14.
* [mbtci-java11-node12](https://hub.docker.com/r/devxci/mbtci-java11-node12) is built from [Dockerfile_mbtci_java11](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/blob/master/Dockerfile_mbtci_java11) using Node 12.
* [mbtci-java11-node14](https://hub.docker.com/r/devxci/mbtci-java11-node14) is built from [Dockerfile_mbtci_java11](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/blob/master/Dockerfile_mbtci_java14) using Node 14.

Additional image which is more light-weight and gives the flexibility to add "per-scenario" the required set of tools:
* [mbtci-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/devxci/mbtci-alpine) is built from [Dockerfile_mbtci_alpine](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool/blob/master/Dockerfile_mbtci_alpine).

##### How to pull the images
You should choose the relevant image type from following list to replace the `<TYPE>` template in the command/FROM according your MTA project technologies:
* java8-node12
* java8-node14
* java11-node12
* java11-node14
* alpine

From the command line:
```
$ docker pull devxci/mbtci-<TYPE>:latest
``` 
or 
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/sap/mbtci-<TYPE>:latest
```

From Dockerfile as a base image: 
```
FROM devxci/mbtci-<TYPE>:latest
```
or
```
FROM ghcr.io/sap/mbtci-<TYPE>:latest
```

E.g. if your MTA project uses Java 11 and Node 14 then you should pull the relevant image as follows: 

From the command line: 
```
$ docker pull devxci/mbtci-java11-node14:latest
```
or
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/sap/mbtci-java11-node14:latest
```

From Dockerfile as a base image: 
```
FROM devxci/mbtci-java11-node14:latest
```
or
```
FROM ghcr.io/sap/mbtci-java11-node14:latest
```

##### How to use the images
You should choose the relevant image type from following list to replace the `<TYPE>` template in the command according your MTA project technologies:
* java8-node12
* java8-node14
* java11-node12
* java11-node14
* alpine

On a Linux/Darwin machine you can run:
```
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/[proj-releative-path]:/project" devxci/mbtci-<TYPE>:latest mbt build -p=cf -t [target-folder-name]
```
This will build an mtar file for SAP Cloud Platform (Cloud Foundry). The folder containing the project needs to be mounted into the image at /project.

<b>Note:</b> The parameter `-p=cf` can be omitted as the build for cloud foundry is the default build, this is an example of the MBT build parameters, for further commands see MBT docs.

##### How to build the images
To buid the images, you should choose the relevant docker file type from following list to replace the `<TYPE>` template in the Dockerfile according your MTA project Java version:
* java8
* java11

Copy the docker file template:
```
cp Dockerfile_<TYPE> Dockerfile
```
E.g. copy the docker file used for Java 8:
```
cp Dockerfile_java8 Dockerfile
```
Replace `NODE_VERSION_TEMPLATE` with your Node version in the Dockerfile:
```
ARG NODE_VERSION=NODE_VERSION_TEMPLATE
```
Then you can build the image:
```
docker build -t devxci/mbtci .
```

To build the mbtci-alpine image you can run:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile_alpine -t devxci/mbtci .
```

##### The images provide:

- Cloud MTA Build Tool - 1.2.4
- Nodejs - 12.22.5 or 14.17.5
- Maven - 3.6.3
- Golang - 1.14.7
- Java - 8 or 11

The MTA Archive Builder delegates module builds to other native build tools. These images provide Node.js, Maven, Java, and Golang so the archive builder can delegate to these build technologies. In case other build tools are needed, <b>inherit</b> from one of these images and add more build tools.
