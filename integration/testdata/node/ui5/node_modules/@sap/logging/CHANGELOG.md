### Added

## 3.0.0 - 2017-04-12

### Changed
- Automatic location tracking for tracers has been removed due to severe performance impact. This affects application code as follows:
  * A location (path to a file) needs to be explicitly passed to the `getTracer` functions as first argument. Passing `__filename` as a location is recommended.
  * A tracer is no longer associated with the script it is currently being used in, but with the location provided for its instantiation.
  * A function name (a string) should be passed as a first argument to the `entering`, `exiting`, `throwing` and `catching` methods of tracers.
